# Welcome!
## Todo-app api
This is the API for a suite of portfolio projects, a *backend to support a range of front-end projects*. This app uses an *Express.js*, *Sequalize.js*, and *PostgreSQL* stack created from the ground up by yours truly, with guidance from other students and staff at the institution I am attending *Kenzie Academy*. I have built this app with industry standards in mind and intend it to reflect best practices as well as I can to gain reference-able experience. Feel free to leave comments anywhere that needs improvement to better achieve this goal, I am always hoping to improve and this project is certainly an iterative process. Cheers!
